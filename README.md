### Onboarding steps

This project was bootstrapped with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" alt="Create React App">Create React App </a>.

- Clone repo
- Ensure you have Docker, Node/npm, and PHP installed
- run `npm i` to install root dependencies
- Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env`
- in project root run `npm run dev` to initiate the container and build the database and seed it. Check out `deploy/build_run_app.sh` to see whats happening under the hood

### Helpful info

- from project root `npm run dev` to start the up
- `docker-compose exec app php ./server/artisan` will give you a list of all your standard laravel commands
- `docker-compose exec app php ./server/artisan migrate:fresh` to drop all the tables and re-run all migrations
- `docker-compose exec app php ./server/artisan db:seed --class=DevSeeder` to reseed the db

### Database Info

- The db configs are located in `server/config/database.php` or your can overwrite them in the `server/.env` file. If you change anything in the `.env`, kill the container and restart it.

### Troubleshooting

- `docker ps`, then `docker kill {3-4 digits of container ID}`
- issues with your db? Easiest way to reset is `php artisan migrate:refresh` within the `/server` directory
- if changes in your `server/.env` dont seem to be taking place. kill the container then run `docker-compose build --no-cache`. Once done, kill it and run `npm run dev`
